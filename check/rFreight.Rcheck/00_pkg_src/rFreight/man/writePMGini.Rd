\title{Writes the ini file for the PMG application}
\usage{
writePMGini(pmg_vars, pmg_ini_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{pmg_vars}{List of named ini file variables}

\item{pmg_ini_path}{Path to ini file including ini file name, can be a relative path (character string)}
}
\description{
Writes the ini file for the PMG application based on variables that have been set
and combined into a list, specifically:
RandomSeed, IMax, Verbose, DynamicAlternatePayoffs, ClairvoyantInitialExpectedPayoffs,
SellersRankOffersByOrderSize, InitExpPayoff, Temptation, BothCoop, BothDefect,
Sucker, RefusalPayoff, WallflowerPayoff, BuyersIgnoreSoldOutSellers,
IgnoreSoldOutSellersMinBuyerSellerRatio, and RawFastParser
}

# should initial expected tradeoffs know size of other traders?

# should sellers accept offers based on order size instead of expected payoff?
pmg_vars$SellersRankOffersByOrderSize <- 1
# multiplier to goose initial expected tradeoff to encourage experimentation with other traders

# amount to downgrade expected payoff of seller who outright refuses a trade offer by buyer

# negative payoff to sellers for not participating
pmg_vars$WallflowerPayoff <- 0.0

#faster reading of input files but does less checks (ok for use with R)
